    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats
        and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist
        slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Arborio rice</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>Hot broth
            Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says
            to make up for evaporation as it sits.</li>
        <li>Toast the rice
            An essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent
            around the edges. This could take a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process.</li>
        <li>Stir
            Yes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the starch from the grains of rice to make
            that creamy texture you want. Do you have to stir constantly? No. Stir after each half cup of broth you add
            to make sure the broth is distributed evenly, then stir again every 30 seconds or so until almost all the
            broth is absorbed. Add another half cup of broth and repeat. Listen to music. Sip some wine. Good risotto is
            worth the time it takes.</li>
        <li>Temperature
            Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout.</li>
        <li>Texture
            Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as
            dry as steamed rice, but should have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if needed
            before stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately
            Risotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even when it's off the heat, so be prepared to
            dish it up right away.</li>


    </ol>
